            STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, arts, and math.
            Developing children are often presented with toys, games, and
            educational materials that help them learn math and literacy skills.
            However, building problem solving and reasoning skills are just as
            important. STEAM toys help kids develop these skills through fun
            science experiments, construction, and use of technology. Some of
            our favorite STEAM toys include LEGO Ideas, Chemistry and Physics
            toys, and Anatomy and Biology toys.

            Toys are the most favourite of kids. They always love to play with
            toys. We cannot find any kind who does not love toys. Parents always
            try to buy toys for children so that their children may play with
            them and be happy. But when buying toys parents should remember
            certain things. Most of the toys that are available in the common
            market are made with low-quality materials. The makers use low
            quality plastic for making toys as a result when a kid plays with
            those toys and sometimes take those toys in their mouth they become
            contaminated with the harmful plastic. But don&quot;t be
            panic-stricken because now there are many toy companies available in
            Bangladesh that manufactures high-quality toys using food grade
            plastic so even if a kid takes a toy in his mouth he remains safe.
